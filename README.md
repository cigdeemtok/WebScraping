# WebScraping
This is a project that we did for our software development class. Its purpose is taking notebook data from e-commerce sites and using them on our database.

We coded this with python and used BeautifulSoup and requests library for web scraping. As a database, we used mongoDB. And then we did near duplicate control to datas we took. There were nearly 400 data in the database. We did some filtering operations using mongoDB.
